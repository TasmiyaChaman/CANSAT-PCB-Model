# CanSat PCB Model Project

## Overview
This repository contains the PCB design and simulation code for a CanSat (Canister Satellite) project, focusing on simulating the landing sequence of a planetary probe. The PCB design utilizes Teensy 4.1 for control and telemetry functionalities.

## Features
- **Teensy 4.1 Microcontroller**: Used for processing and controlling the CanSat operations.
- **Custom PCB Design**: Designed to integrate sensors, communication modules, and control circuitry.
- **Simulation Code**: Implements the landing sequence simulation and operational algorithms.
- **Telemetry System**: Facilitates data transmission and reception during the mission.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `docs/`: Documentation files.
- `pcb_design/`: PCB design files and schematics.
- `simulation_code/`: Code for simulating the landing sequence.
- `tests/`: Test scripts and results.
